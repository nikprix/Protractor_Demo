# Protractor Demo

TODO form verification.

**NOTE**

- Project was created and tested using Mac OS
- There are 2 specs which will fail since there is an issue with the Todo form's footer sections
and both specs were coded to validate against correct expected behavior.

## Installation

1. Install Node.js (https://nodejs.org/en/download/)
2. Install Grunt-cli globally: `npm install -g grunt-cli`
3. Clone project from GitHub: `git clone https://github.com/nikprix/Protractor_Demo.git`
4. Proceed to the project's root folder
5. Run `npm install` to load all required node packages
6. Run `grunt install` to run all required grunt tasks

*Example:* Install both Node.js and Grunt-cli. Then clone project locally using 
command: `git clone https://github.com/nikprix/Protractor_Demo.git`. Switch to the project's folder ('Protractor_Demo')
and run `npm install` then `grunt install`.
